# Project 1 - Weather Data Analysis

## Project Overview
Dive into this comprehensive Weather Data Analysis project where real-world weather data is explored and interpreted using Python's powerful data analysis library, pandas. This project demonstrates essential data handling and analysis techniques including data filtering, grouping, statistical calculations, and insightful querying on a dataset containing over 8,000 weather observations.

## What’s Inside
- **weather.csv** — A rich dataset with detailed weather information collected over time.
- **weather.ipynb** — A Jupyter notebook that walks you through step-by-step data exploration and analysis, perfect for beginners and enthusiasts alike.

## Key Features
- Load and inspect large datasets effortlessly.
- Extract meaningful insights by filtering weather conditions and wind speeds.
- Calculate important statistical metrics like mean, variance, and standard deviation.
- Use grouping to summarize data based on different weather conditions.
- Identify specific weather events such as Snow and Fog through precise queries.

## How to Use This Project
1. Open 'weather.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run through the cells sequentially to see how the data is processed and analyzed.
